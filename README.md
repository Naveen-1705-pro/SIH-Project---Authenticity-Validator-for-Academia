# SIH-Project---Authenticity-Validator-for-Academia
With growing digitization, fake degrees and forged certificates have become a major concern for institutions, employers, and governments. The lack of secure, verifiable systems allows fraud to thrive. Adopting digital solutions like blockchain and stricter checks is vital to protect the credibility of academic credentials.
Got it 👍 You’re using a **basic frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)** instead of React or Next.js.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Institution Issuance** – University/college uploads student credentials.
2. **Blockchain Hashing** – Credential hash stored on blockchain for immutability.
3. **Verification** – Employers scan or enter certificate ID for authenticity check.
4. **Student Wallet** – Students receive a secure credential copy linked to blockchain record.
